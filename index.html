      <h2>No-one would dispute that The Beatles have been influential. Heck, they’re pretty much the most influential artist of all time. But is there anything Wikipedia can tell us about just how popular they are?</h2>

    <h4>Introduction</h4>
    <p>This data was produced by looking at all the articles on Wikipedia that link back to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Beatles">The Beatles main wikipedia page</a>. As you can imagine, the topics that are seemingly related are super varied. From x to y, and even z.

    Now, obviously measuring influence is difficult. The data from Wikipedia is by no means an entirely comprehensive record of this. This is merely a fun project to see where and how they have been recorded as having been part of everyday culture in ways no one ever imagined. Here are some details about where The Beatles influence has reached. </p>

    <h4>Articles referencing a time period</h4>
    <p>Even today The Beatles are winning awards (LINK) and being written about. But what can we reveal about the period they had an influence on? Well as you can see……</p>

    <h4>Artists that Reference The Beatles in their works</h4>
    <p>For this I looked at the performers that are associated with the articles to see who is most commonly associated with The Beatles. Besides The Beatles themselves, a surprising (at least for me) winner is an artist by the name of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Al_Di_Meola"></a>Al Di Meola who is a Jazz and world music artist. Al Di Meola appears to have been greatly influenced by The Beatles in his works, of which there are quite a few, and even recorded <a href="https://www.discogs.com/Al-Di-Meola-All-Your-Life-A-Tribute-To-The-Beatles-Recorded-At-Abbey-Road-Studios-London/release/5058003">a tribute album.</a> Most of the other artists are not surprising, with Bob Dylan, Elvis Presley, Bee Gees, The Rolling Stones, The Beach Boys and Oasis all referencing The Beatles in a number of their articles.</p>
